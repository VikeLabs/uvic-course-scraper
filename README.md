# uvic-course-scraper


UVic Course Scraper is a Node.js library that parses information from [University of Victoria](https://uvic.ca) (UVic) course calandar and course schedule information sources. It uses [Cheerio](https://cheerio.js.org/) under the hood to parse HTML.

As a developer, you would use this to parse HTML and JSON from Kuali and BAN1P which would be retrieved by any method like fetch etc.

## Install
```
npm install @vikelabs/uvic-course-scraper
```

## API
The following table provides descriptions of the methods available on the object generated by `UVicCourseScraper()`.
| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
|``getAllCourses()``|Returns ``KualiCourseCatalog[]`` with all active courses in the Kuali catalog|
|``getCourseDetails(pid: string)``|Returns ``KualiCourseItem`` with details for the course with the given pid|
|``getCourseSections(subject: string, code: string, term: string)``|Returns ``ClassScheduleListing[]`` with section details for all sections of the course in the given term|
|``getSectionSeats(term: string, crn: string)``|Returns ``DetailedClassInformation`` with the `seats` and `waitListSeats` for the course|

## Example
```ts
const { UVicCourseScraper } = require('@vikelabs/uvic-course-scraper');

// get all courses from the Kuali course catalog
const allCourses: KualiCourseCatalog[] = await UVicCourseScraper.getAllCourses();
const courseTitle: string = allCourses[0].title;

// get course details for course with pid 'ByS23Pp7E' (in this case thats ACAN 225)
const courseDetails: KualiCourseItem = await UVicCourseScraper.getCourseDetails('ByS23Pp7E');
const courseDescription: string = courseDetails[0].description;
const courseLectureHours: string = courseDetails[0].hoursCatalogText.lecture;

// get course sections for CSC 111 in spring 2021
const courseSections: ClassScheduleListing[] = await UVicCourseScraper.getCourseSections('202101', 'CSC', '111');
const courseSectionCode: string = courseSections[0].sectionCode;

// get seats for course section with CRN 10953 in spring 2021 (in this case thats ECE 260 - A01)
const sectionSeats: DetailedClassInformation = await UVicCourseScraper.getSectionSeats('202101', '10953');
const sectionTotalSeats: number = sectionSeats.seats.capacity;
```

## Developing
1. Clone the repo:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/VikeLabs/uvic-course-scraper.git
    ```
2. Run `npm install`
3. Optionally, experiment with `example.ts` using `npx ts-node-dev src/example/example.ts` to get a feel for how cheerio and RegEx works on the type of sites our project is scraping.
4. Find an unassigned task on [ZenHub](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/team-schedule-courses-5f973f50ae36d70012eb5b2e/board?repos=216653028) to work on.
5. Create a new branch using `git checkout -b <branch-name>` (make sure it's up to date with `master`)
6. Commit the changes you've made and push to GitHub to create a Pull Request.

## Testing

This project uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) testing framework. You can execute tests by running `npm test`.

This will execute tests using Jest files with the extension `*.test*`.

`npx jest --watch` will put Jest into watch mode, which will execute tests as files change.

## Developer Tools

This repository contains a CLI to make development related tasks easier.

```
npm run dump -- --term 202009 --type courses
```

- Dumps the course details for the `202009` term.
- Outputs to a `courses.json` file.

```
npm run dump -- --term 202009 --type schedules
```

- Dumps the schedule details for all `202009` term classes.
- This schedule details corresponds to the `Class Schedule Listing` page view on BAN1P.
- This command can only be run after dumping courses data.

```
npm run dump -- --term 202009 --type class --crn 10953
```

- Dumps the HTML of a "Detailed Class Information" page for a given term and CRN.

```
npm run dump -- --term 202009 --type sections
```

- Dumps the section details for all `202009` term classes by crn.
- This command can only be run after dumping schedules data.

## Target Pages

The following are some of the pages we are currently parsing.

### Schedule Information (BAN1P)

#### Class Schedule Listing

[Class Schedule Listing - ECE 260 - 202009](https://www.uvic.ca/BAN1P/bwckctlg.p_disp_listcrse?term_in=202009&subj_in=ECE&crse_in=260&schd_in=)

This is where all the information for a specific class will be parsed such as when the term is, location, CRN, etc. You can change the query string parameters `term_in`, `subj_in`, and `crse_in` to anything you'd like to view other class listings. For example, `202101`, `CHEM`, and `101` could be put in the respective locations.

#### Detailed Class Information

[Detailed Class Information](https://www.uvic.ca/BAN1P/bwckschd.p_disp_detail_sched?term_in=202009&crn_in=10953)

This is where all the information for a specific section of a class will be parsed such as the class and waitlist capacity. You can change the parameters `term_in`, `crn_in`, to anything you'd like to view other class listings. For example, `202101` and `12345` could be put in the respective locations.

### Course Information (Kuali)

The course information from this source is _mostly_ in `JSON` already so this library does not do much and is mainly used to create a list of courses for other processes. However, there is some parsing done. The `preAndCorequisites` field is `HTML` so we _intend_ to parse this.

[Kuali Courses Catalog Info](https://uvic.kuali.co/api/v1/catalog/courses/5d9ccc4eab7506001ae4c225)

This is the `JSON` file which contains **basic** information about every course being offered and some courses that were offered recently.

To get more detailed information about a course, one much make another request using the `pid` value from the above `JSON`

[Kuali Course Info](https://uvic.kuali.co/api/v1/catalog/course/5d9ccc4eab7506001ae4c225/ByS23Pp7E)

This contains detailed information about a class like:

- Description
- Requirements
- Pre and co-requisites
